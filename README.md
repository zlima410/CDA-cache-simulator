# CDA-cache-simulator
In this project, you will simulate a CPU cache (unified instruction/data) and integrate the cache into the Project 1 simulator.  As the processor simulator executes a program, it will access instructions and data.  These accesses will be serviced by the cache, which will transfer data to/from  memory as needed.
